// HOW IT WORKS — four tabs across the top (title + description each), one full
// width visual below that crossfades to the active tab. Each tab carries a
// progress bar along its top edge that fills over the dwell time, so you can
// anticipate when the visual is about to switch (Intercom-style). It auto
// advances and loops; click a tab to jump, hover to pause. Progress is painted
// imperatively (refs) so the loop never re-renders the visuals.
//
// Tabs are titles-only; the per-step `body` copy is kept in the data but not
// rendered (drop it back under each title if the visuals ever need support).
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
