    question: "What can I actually build?",
    answer:
      "Two kinds of apps: client-facing apps and internal tools. Think onboarding wizards, document collection, project trackers, approval workflows, client dashboards. Apps can use AI too — like an assistant that answers client questions from your firm's own docs.\n\nClient-facing apps are where Assembly is strongest — every app has two sides, so your team works in your dashboard while each client gets their own view inside your branded client experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Assembly different?",
    answer:
      "Other AI builders spin up slick prototypes that are difficult to make production-ready — and often never make it in front of a client. Assembly closes that gap.\n\nBecause Assembly has a CRM and client experience foundation built in, the apps you describe go live where your team and clients already are — hosting, authentication, permissions, payments, notifications, and branding all handled securely for you. You build the part that's distinctly yours; Assembly already runs the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to know how to code?",
    answer:
      "No. Describe what you want. The app builder asks a few product questions, shows you a plan you approve or edit, then builds. Changes happen the same way — by conversation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there templates I can start from?",
    answer:
      "Yes — 30+ app templates covering common workflows and specific industries, from accounting document collection to agency approval flows. Start from one and it's yours: reshape it by chat until it fits exactly how your firm works.\n\nTemplates are a great fit if you'd rather start from something proven than describe an app from scratch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can my apps connect to the tools I already use?",
    answer:
      "Yes — apps can connect to any third-party service. When you build an app that needs one, the app builder prompts you to authenticate the tool or provide an API key, and it's wired in from there.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep changing an app after it's live?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Apps aren't frozen at publish — keep chatting with the app builder to refine anything, whenever your workflow changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer:
      "Start free, stay free — the free plan never expires, and you can build and publish real apps on it. Every plan includes a set number of apps and monthly build credits for creating and editing them. Upgrade as your firm grows for more apps, more credits, and more capability. Full details on our pricing page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes — and security on Assembly is platform infrastructure, not something the AI generates. Clients sign in with secure magic links or Google. Roles and permissions are maintained by the platform, and a structural boundary separates what your team sees from what your clients see — no prompt can cross it. Every app is born inside these protections. Full details on our security page.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Assembly not good for?",
    answer:
      "Public-facing sites. Assembly builds apps for authenticated experiences — your team and your logged-in clients. Marketing websites, public directories, and consumer apps are better built elsewhere.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who owns what I build?",
    answer:
      "You do. Every app you build is yours — your data, your logic, your workflows. We never use your apps, your data, or your clients' data to train AI models, and we don't share them with anyone.",
