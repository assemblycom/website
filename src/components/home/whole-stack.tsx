                  glyph directly above it. The plus already sits exactly on the
                  content rail; the nav mark stops 6px short of it, because its
                  22px icon is centred in a 36px tap target and the dots carry
                  their own bearing inside that. Two marks on the same edge of
                  the same screen have to agree, and the nav is the one the
                  reader sees on every page. */}
