// PROPOSAL — a page made for one person. Someone on the team refined a prompt
// (or picked the template that fits) and sent them this link; it opens with
// who it's prepared for and closes with a signup that already carries the build.
//
// Everything comes from the URL, so the link IS the proposal:
//   ?for=Jonathan          who it's prepared for
//   ?name=…                what the prompt builds, in two or three words
//   ?prompt=…              the refined prompt, shown in full and editable
//   ?template=slug         a template instead, as a cover and a summary
//   ?from=Sean Walsh       who prepared it
//   ?note=…                one personal line under the title
//
// It reads as a document in three parts — who it's for and what it is, the
// build itself, then how signing up turns it into a real app — and carries no
// navigation at all: there is one thing to do on it.

// px-6 md:px-10, h-14 under lg and h-16 at it), and the mark is its 22px. So the
// logo lands exactly where it does on every other page, and this page's head
// reads as the site's own even though it carries no links.
