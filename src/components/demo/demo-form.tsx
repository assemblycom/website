          near-black in dark.
          Two treatments, because the form is two different shapes. On a phone it
          stacks into something far taller than the screen, so an in-place overlay
          lands the card halfway down a long form with fields above and below it:
          there this is a fixed modal, centred in the viewport with the page dimmed
          behind. From lg the form fits on screen beside the visual, so the card
          sits over it in place, lifted above the midpoint by the bottom padding
          because centred it sat low against the heading. */}
