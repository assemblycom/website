 * The industry landing pages. They came out of Contentful — where they were
 * filed under a "solutions/" slug prefix the route dropped — and now live in
 * solutions.frozen.ts, imagery and all. One of the seven is noIndex, which the
 * frozen copy carries the way the CMS did.
 *
 * Seven, not nine: /solutions/accounting-client-portal and
 * /solutions/marketing-agency-client-portal are hand-built pages of their own
 * now, so their CMS copy came out of the frozen set.
 *
 * This replaces solutions.fallback.ts, which held the same copy as a floor for
 * a CMS outage. There is no CMS read left to fall back from.
