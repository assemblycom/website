/**
 * Contentful is the catalogue, and a published App Template entry has two
 * separate consequences:
 *
 *  - It EXISTS on the site. It gets /templates/[slug] and it is offered in the
 *    proposal creator. Neither depends on the Hidden flag: the detail page is a
 *    link you send someone, and the proposal creator is an internal tool, so
 *    both are meant to reach templates that aren't announced yet. Use
 *    getCatalogueTemplates() for these.
 *  - It is LISTED. It shows in the /templates gallery and the homepage strip
 *    only while Hidden is off. Use getVisibleTemplates() for these.
 *
 * Contentful's `hideProduct` is a product-side flag; the site doesn't read it.
 *
 * Server-only, and that is the whole shape of this problem: the gallery, the
 * homepage strip and the proposal picker are client components that used to read
 * the committed array at module scope, where an await can't reach — which is why
 * the CMS had no say over any of them. Each is now handed its list by the server
 * page that renders it.
 *
 * TEMPLATES itself stays whole. Lookups by slug — a proposal naming a template
 * that left the catalogue after it was sent — must still resolve.

 * template read as unranked and sorted below the core apps, which carry no
 * committed record and so were the only entries with a rank at all — which is
 * exactly the two-groups ordering this was meant to remove.
 *
 * Template id is the app the product resolves the template by, and Contentful is
 * the authority for it — the detail page has always read it that way. The
 * listings did not, so a committed record lacking an id silently dropped the
 * one the CMS held, and the card's own Get started link lost its deeplink while
 * the detail page's kept it. A template committed with no id is the normal case
 * rather than an edge: the id is a value worth leaving out until it is known.
