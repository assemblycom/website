 * Whether the visitor is signed in to Assembly. The app

 * origins, so the app's session can't be read directly. Instead the app sets a
 * non-httpOnly cookie on the shared `.assembly.com` parent domain, which any
 * page under that domain can read client-side.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP: nothing sets this cookie yet. The dashboard's only cookie is
 * written host-only (no `domain` attribute), so it is invisible here and every
 * visitor currently resolves to signed-out. SESSION_COOKIE must be matched to
 * whatever the app team ships before any of this does anything in production.
 *
 * A Vercel preview URL is not under `.assembly.com` either, so the cookie is
 * never visible there — use the demo override below to see both states.

 * variants and the stylesheet picks one off this attribute (see `.auth-only` /
 * `.unauth-only` in globals.css). Deciding in an effect instead meant a
 * signed-in visitor watched the nav, the pricing grid and the comparison table
 * render signed-out and then rearrange.
 *
 * Failing closed to "0" matters: signed-out is the state the markup is written
 * for, so a thrown script leaves a correct page rather than a blank one.
