// the one fixed /og.jpg — this is for the two surfaces where the preview is
// about a specific app, and where a generic card tells the reader nothing.
//
// The name leads, top-left and large, rather than sitting on one centred line
// beside the wordmark. The wordmark comes off with it: at this size the mark
// alone says whose card it is, and "Assembly" set next to the app's name read as
// part of the name.
//
// A route handler rather than Next's opengraph-image convention because the
// proposal's name lives in the query string, and opengraph-image is only handed
// route params. One endpoint serves both surfaces from ?title= and ?v=.
