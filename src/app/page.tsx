// Re-resolved against Contentful every few minutes rather than only at deploy.
// Prerendered once, an editor hiding a template in the CMS had no effect until
// somebody happened to ship — which is not what "the CMS is the catalogue" can
// mean in practice. Five minutes is short enough that a change lands while the
// person who made it is still looking, and long enough that crawlers aren't
// re-running the query on every hit.
// Only the canonical, deliberately: the layout already sets this page's title,
// description and card, and routing home through pageMetadata() would push its
// title through the "Assembly | %s" template and brand it twice.
//
// Written out rather than left to the layout's relative "./". Relative resolves
// against the route, and for the root route that came out as /index — a URL that
// does not exist, offered to crawlers as the canonical one.
